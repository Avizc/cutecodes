Coding challenges and puzzles with Avi's solution to them.

I like to re-do the same problems and challenges over and over in different ways so figured I'd sort out my solutions in a simplified manner here. That and over time see my progression in a somewhat straight forward view as I work up on building my coding and programming skills back up. Eventually it'll have solutions in multiple languages with the exclusion of Java (it was my primary language for years, for personal reasons I am trying to move away from it completely).

All problems and challenges in the repo will be their own directory, have a README describing the challenge, the files being the solutions. 

Please feel free to give me puzzles and challenges by forking this over, adding a new directory in the same style as the rest of this repo, I'll merge it over and then solve whatever you have for me. That or if you want to do the same problems and challenges I've done feel free to fork it also.
